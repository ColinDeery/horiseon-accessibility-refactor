# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor

## Description

- This accessibility refactor was performed in order to further expand and exercise my knowledge of HTML and CSS for a live webpage.
- By removing div elements, this website's codebase is both more easily legible and malleable for future programmers.
- Through the completion of this refactor, I became more familiar with the intercommunication between an HTML file and its corresponding CSS style sheet.


## Usage

For ease of use, the navigation buttons located along the header will redirect the user to their respective content sections further down on the webpage.

## Credits

This webpage's accesibility refactor was made possible by the tutelage of my bootcamp instructor Leif E. Hetland and by the support and encouragement of my cohorts.

Additional resources used included W3School's guide on HTML semantic elements:
